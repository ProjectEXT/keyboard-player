QVault Hackathon - My resulting code after 5hrs.

This is my first real project I've done, if we ignore the other small repositories. The goal of the hackathon was to create a digital instrument anyway we prefer. At the moment, the only programming languages I've dabbled in left me with choosing to create a website with HTML, CSS, & Javascript. I had to use alot of sources & googling to figure out how to make most of it to work, and because of that I've learned alot of how a website works & what you can do.

*How-to:* First, clone the repository & host it locally. After selecting a music theme you like, use the keys on your keyboard that are shown on the screen to play a sound/chime. The idea is with enough time, you can create a whacky & odd rythm that could make a neat song.

*Known bugs:*
- Github Deployment doesn't like to use my stylesheet, must be shy.
- Coins & Pause do not repeat sounds when clicking a button multiple times.
